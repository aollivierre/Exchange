**IT Guide: Managing Exchange Attributes and Remote User Mailboxes**

# RBAC Roles and Permissions Required

**RBAC Roles and Permissions Required**

To effectively manage Exchange attributes and remote user mailboxes in a hybrid Exchange environment, specific Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) roles and permissions are required across your on-premises Active Directory (AD), Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), and synchronization tools like Entra ID Connect Sync. This section outlines the necessary roles and best practices for maintaining secure administrative access.

**On-Premises Active Directory and Exchange Server**

**Active Directory Permissions:**

- **Account Operators** or **Delegated User Management Permissions**:
  - Required to create, modify, and delete user accounts in Active Directory.
  - Allows for setting passwords and managing user properties.

**Exchange Server Permissions:**

- **Recipient Management Role Group**:
  - Grants permissions to manage mailboxes, mail users, mail contacts, and distribution groups.
  - Essential for managing recipients in both on-premises and hybrid environments.
- **Organization Management Role Group**:
  - Provides full administrative access to all Exchange features.
  - Should be assigned sparingly due to its broad scope.

**Assigning Roles in Exchange On-Premises:**

- Use the **Exchange Admin Center** or **Exchange Management Shell** to assign administrators to the appropriate role groups.

**Example using Exchange Management Shell:**

Add-RoleGroupMember -Identity "Recipient Management" -Member "AdminUser"

**Entra ID (Formerly Azure Active Directory) and Exchange Online**

**Entra ID Permissions:**

- **User Administrator**:
  - Can manage all aspects of users and groups, including resetting passwords and assigning licenses.
  - Ideal for administrators who handle user account management.
- **Exchange Administrator**:
  - Grants permissions to manage Exchange Online recipients, mailbox settings, and compliance features.
  - Necessary for managing mailboxes and recipient objects in Exchange Online.

**Assigning Roles in Entra ID:**

- Use the **Entra ID Admin Center** or **Microsoft 365 Admin Center** to assign roles.

**Steps:**

- 1. Navigate to the **Entra ID Admin Center** (<https://entra.microsoft.com>).
  2. Select **Roles and administrators**.
  3. Choose the appropriate role (e.g., **User Administrator** or **Exchange Administrator**).
  4. Click **Add assignments** and select the user to assign the role.

**Exchange Online RBAC Roles:**

- **Recipient Management Role Group**:
  - Similar to the on-premises role group but applies to Exchange Online.
  - Allows administrators to manage Exchange Online recipients.

**Assigning Roles in Exchange Online:**

- Use the **Exchange Admin Center** for Exchange Online:

**Steps:**

- 1. Navigate to the **Exchange Admin Center** (<https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com>).
  2. Click on **Permissions** in the left-hand menu.
  3. Under **Admin Roles**, select **Recipient Management**.
  4. Click **Edit** to add members to the role group.

**Entra ID Connect Sync (Formerly Azure AD Connect Sync)**

**Permissions for Entra ID Connect Sync:**

- **On-Premises Permissions:**
  - **Enterprise Admin** permissions are required during the initial setup. (will be used to create MSOL_XXXXXX sync service account in AD.
  - For ongoing synchronization, a service account with **Replicating Directory Changes** permissions is sufficient.
- **Entra ID Permissions:**
  - The account used for Entra ID Connect Sync should have the **Hybrid Identity Administrator** role.
  - This role allows for configuring synchronization settings and managing hybrid identities.

**Best Practices for Entra ID Connect Sync:**

- **Use Dedicated Service Accounts:**
  - Create dedicated service accounts for synchronization processes.
  - Assign only the minimum required permissions to these accounts.
- **Monitor Synchronization:**
  - Regularly check synchronization logs and health reports to ensure that directory synchronization is functioning correctly.

# Best Practices for Administrative Accounts

- **Separate On-Premises and Cloud-Only Admin Accounts:**
  - **Avoid Synchronizing Admin Accounts to Entra ID:**
    - To enhance security, do not synchronize on-premises administrative accounts to Entra ID.
    - Synchronizing admin accounts can expose them to additional risks if cloud credentials are compromised.
  - **Use Cloud-Only Admin Accounts in Entra ID:**
    - Create separate, cloud-only administrative accounts in Entra ID for managing cloud services.
    - These accounts are not linked to on-premises identities and provide an additional layer of security.
- **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
  - Enable MFA for all administrative accounts to protect against unauthorized access.
    - Option 1 â€“ via Entra ID Conditional Access Policies (Recommended)
    - Option 2 - via Entra ID Legacy Per-user MFA (less recommended)
    - Option 3 â€“ via Entra ID Security Defaults (less recommended)
  - MFA adds a critical layer of security by requiring a second form of verification.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:**
  - Assign the minimal permissions necessary for administrators to perform their tasks.
  - Regularly review and adjust permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.
- **Use Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs):**
  - Administer sensitive systems from dedicated, secure workstations.
  - PAWs reduce the risk of credential theft and unauthorized access.

**Important Considerations**

- **Role Assignments are Environment-Specific:**
  - Roles assigned in on-premises environments do not automatically carry over to Entra ID or Exchange Online.
  - Ensure that administrators have the necessary roles in each environment they manage.
- **Compliance and Audit Trail:**
  - Maintain logs of role assignments and changes to administrative permissions.
  - Regular audits help in detecting unauthorized changes and ensuring compliance with organizational policies.
- **Training and Awareness:**
  - Provide administrators with training on security best practices and the proper use of their assigned roles.
  - Awareness reduces the risk of accidental misconfigurations or security breaches.

**Summary of Required Roles**

| **Task** | **On-Premises Role** | **Entra ID Role** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create user accounts | Account Operators | User Administrator |
| Manage mailboxes and recipients | Recipient Management Role Group | Exchange Administrator |
| Assign or remove licenses | N/A | User Administrator |
| Configure Exchange settings | Exchange Administrator Role Group | Exchange Administrator |
| Manage directory synchronization | N/A | Hybrid Identity Administrator |

# Enabling Exchange Hybrid Writeback in Entra ID Connect Sync

In a hybrid Exchange environment, it's recommended to enable **Exchange Hybrid writeback** in **Entra ID Connect Sync** (formerly Azure AD Connect Sync). This feature ensures that your on-premises Active Directory (AD) remains the source of authority by synchronizing certain attributes from Exchange Online back to your on-premises AD. This synchronization maintains consistency of user and mailbox attributes when changes are made to Exchange Online mailboxes.


> ðŸ”” **Note:** If you have Azure AD Premium P1 (Entra ID P1) licenses, enabling all write-back features in Azure AD Connect Sync (traditional sync produc) towards the very end of the configuratrion wizard is a smart move in most hybrid environments.


**Benefits of Enabling Exchange Hybrid Writeback**

- **Attribute Consistency:** Ensures that changes made to mailboxes in Exchange Online are reflected in your on-premises AD. This includes attributes like proxy addresses and mail routing settings, which are crucial for proper email flow and user management.
- **Source of Authority Maintenance:** Keeps your on-premises AD as the authoritative source for directory information, which is essential for hybrid deployments.
- **Simplified Management:** Reduces administrative overhead by automatically synchronizing necessary attributes, eliminating the need for manual updates in both environments.
- **Enhanced Hybrid Functionality:** Supports features like on-premises distribution group management and allows for seamless coexistence between on-premises and cloud environments.

**How to Enable Exchange Hybrid Writeback**

            - Navigate to **Entra ID Admin Center** > **Users** > **Deleted users**.
            - Select the user and click **Restore**.
            - The restored user becomes a cloud-only account.
        - **Run the User Deletion Wizard**:
            - In the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center**, delete the user using the **Delete user** option.
            - This process converts the mailbox to a shared mailbox automatically and allows you to assign OneDrive data to another user.
        - **Note:** This alternative method automates several steps but may not be suitable for all organizations.
4. **Verify Offboarding Completion:**
    - **Mailboxes**:
        - Confirm that the user's mailbox is now a shared mailbox in Exchange Online.
        - Ensure that other users who need access have the appropriate permissions.
    - **Licenses**:
        - Verify that all licenses have been unassigned from the user account.
    - **User Account**:
        - Ensure the user account is disabled in Active Directory and blocked in Entra ID.
    - **Data Access**:

        - Confirm that all authentication sessions have been revoked and that the user cannot access any company resources.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Data Retention Compliance:**
  - Always adhere to your organization's data retention policies.
  - Converting mailboxes to shared mailboxes retains email data without needing a license.
  - OneDrive data retention must be managed separately through SharePoint Online settings.
- **Cloud Backup Solutions:**
  - Utilizing cloud-to-cloud backup solutions like **Datto SaaS Protection** ensures that you have a secure backup of all user data before making any changes.
  - This is especially important if legal holds or compliance requirements mandate data preservation.
- **Disabling vs. Deleting Accounts:**
  - Disabling the user account in Active Directory prevents access but retains the account for any necessary data retrieval.
  - Deleting the account is irreversible and should only be done if you're certain that all data is no longer needed.
- **Disconnecting Mailbox in Exchange On-Premises:**
  - In a hybrid environment, it's generally not necessary to disable or disconnect the mailbox in on-premises Exchange after converting it to a shared mailbox in Exchange Online.
  - The shared mailbox resides in Exchange Online, and the on-premises user account can remain disabled.
- **Security Measures:**
  - Blocking sign-in and revoking authentication tokens prevent the user from accessing any cloud services.
  - Always ensure these steps are taken promptly to secure the environment.
- **Alternative Offboarding Method:**
  - The alternative method of removing the user from the sync scope and restoring them as a cloud-only user may simplify the process but requires careful handling to avoid unintended data loss.
  - Evaluate this option based on your organization's policies and the specific circumstances.

5. **Revoke Access and Authentication Tokens:**

   - **Block Sign-In:**
     - In the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center**, toggle **Block sign-in** to **On** for the user.
   - **Revoke Sessions:**
     - Use Entra ID PowerShell or the Entra ID Admin Center to revoke user sessions and reset authentication methods.
     ```powershell
     # Connect to Entra ID
     Connect-MgGraph -Scopes User.ReadWrite.All
     # Revoke sessions
     Revoke-MgUserSignInSession -UserId "john.doe@yourdomain.com"
     ```

6. **Backup Data (Recommended):**

   - Ensure that mailbox and OneDrive data are backed up using a cloud-to-cloud backup solution (e.g., Datto SaaS Protection).

7. **Force Entra ID Connect Sync Synchronization:**

   - On the server running Entra ID Connect Sync, force a synchronization to update the user's status in Entra ID.
     ```powershell
     Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta
     ```

8. **Verify Offboarding Completion:**

   - Confirm that the user's mailbox is converted to a shared mailbox and accessible as needed.
   - Ensure the user's account is disabled and that licenses have been removed.
   - Verify that OneDrive data has been managed according to policy.
   - Check that the user can no longer access company resources.

**Notes:**

- **Data Retention Policies:**
  - Always follow your organization's data retention and compliance policies when offboarding users.
  - Converting to a shared mailbox retains email data without requiring a license.

- **License Considerations:**
  - Shared mailboxes with over 50 GB of data or with In-Place Archive enabled require a license.
  - Ensure compliance with Microsoft licensing requirements.

- **Security Measures:**
  - Promptly blocking sign-in and revoking sessions helps prevent unauthorized access.
  - Regularly review access logs for any suspicious activity.

## Important Considerations

- **Decommissioning the Last On-Premises Exchange Server:**

  - **Recipient Management Tools Sufficiency:**
    - With the Exchange Recipient Management tools, you can manage recipients without an on-premises Exchange server.
    - This allows you to decommission the last Exchange mailbox server, reducing maintenance overhead.

  - **Schema and Attribute Management:**
    - The Exchange schema extensions must remain in AD.
    - Recipient attributes are still stored in AD and synchronized to Entra ID.

- **Entra ID Connect Sync:**

  - **Role of Entra ID Connect Sync:**
    - Continues to synchronize on-premises AD with Entra ID.
    - Must remain operational to sync changes made via the Recipient Management tools.

  - **Hybrid Writeback:**
    - Ensure that **Exchange Hybrid writeback** is enabled to maintain attribute consistency if required.

- **Administrative Permissions:**

  - **On-Premises AD:**
    - Permissions to modify user objects and Exchange attributes are necessary.
    - Delegate permissions appropriately to adhere to the principle of least privilege.

  - **Exchange Online:**
    - Administrative roles in Entra ID and Exchange Online are required for tasks like converting mailboxes to shared mailboxes.

- **Backup and Recovery:**

  - **Data Protection:**
    - Implement a robust backup solution for cloud data.
    - Regularly test backups to ensure data can be restored when needed.

- **Compliance and Auditing:**

  - **Logging Changes:**
    - Keep records of administrative actions for auditing purposes.
    - Utilize tools like the **Unified Audit Log** in Microsoft 365.

- **Support and Updates:**

  - **Staying Informed:**
    - Keep abreast of updates from Microsoft regarding hybrid environments and management tools.
    - Ensure that management workstations have the latest tools and updates installed.
