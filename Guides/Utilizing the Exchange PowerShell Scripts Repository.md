## Exploring the Repository

The repository contains various scripts organized into directories based on their functionality. Familiarize yourself with the structure:

- **Scripts Directory:**
  - Contains PowerShell scripts (`.ps1` files) for different Exchange management tasks.
- **Modules:**
  - May include custom PowerShell modules for extended functionality.
- **Documentation:**
  - Readme files and documentation that provide details on how to use the scripts.

---

## Using the PowerShell Scripts

### Step 1: Review the Scripts

- **Read the Documentation:**
  - Open the `README.md` file in the repository for an overview.
  - Some scripts may have individual documentation or comments within the script.
- **Understand the Purpose:**
  - Determine which scripts are relevant to your tasks.

### Step 2: Adjust Execution Policy (If Necessary)

To run PowerShell scripts, you may need to adjust the execution policy:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

- **Note:** This allows you to run locally created scripts. Be cautious when changing execution policies.

### Step 3: Run a Script

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator:**

   - Right-click on **Windows PowerShell** and select **Run as administrator**.

2. **Navigate to the Script Directory:**

   ```powershell
   cd C:\Scripts\Exchange\Scripts
   ```

3. **Execute the Script:**

   ```powershell
   .\ScriptName.ps1
   ```

   - Replace `ScriptName.ps1` with the actual script filename.
   - Some scripts may require parameters. Check the script header or documentation.

### Example: Running a Script to List Mailboxes

Suppose there's a script named `Get-MailboxReport.ps1` that generates a report of all mailboxes.

1. **Execute the Script:**

   ```powershell
   .\Get-MailboxReport.ps1
   ```

2. **Provide Required Parameters (If Any):**

   - If the script requires parameters, include them:

     ```powershell
     .\Get-MailboxReport.ps1 -OutputPath "C:\Reports\MailboxReport.csv"
     ```

### Step 4: Schedule Scripts (Optional)

- **Task Scheduler:**
  - Use Windows Task Scheduler to run scripts at scheduled times.
- **Automation:**
  - Automate repetitive tasks by scheduling scripts.

## Security Considerations

### Review Scripts Before Execution

- **Code Review:**
  - Always read and understand the script code before running it.
  - Look for any commands that could potentially harm your system or data.

### Execution Policies

- **Set Appropriate Execution Policies:**
  - Use the least permissive policy that allows your scripts to run.
  - Revert to the default policy after running scripts if increased privileges are not needed.

### Credentials Management

- **Avoid Hardcoding Credentials:**
  - Do not store plain-text passwords or sensitive information in scripts.
- **Secure Storage:**
  - Use secure methods to handle credentials, such as using `Get-Credential` cmdlet or encrypted files.

### Test in a Non-Production Environment

- **Use a Lab Environment:**
  - Test scripts in a controlled environment before running them in production.
- **Backup Data:**
  - Ensure that you have backups of critical data in case of unexpected results.
